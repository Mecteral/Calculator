# Calulator

## Reasons for programming this calculator: 

Its a highly logical system where I could use and play with the skills I learned during an internship. The system needs to be easily extensible and due to that a good ground design is of high priority. The problems I encountered in the calculator had a clear nature, so I could focus directly on the programming and improving my skills with testing, design and algorithmic. Also the calculator doesnâ€™t have an extended User Interface, which meant I could learn be key elements and focus again on testability and a proper MVVM design. I also wanted a project that I could finish in the span of 6-9 months. So the calculator was an obvious choice for the needs I had at the time.

## What can the Calculator do:

The Calculator is able to convert between the metrical and imperial system regarding Length, Mass, Volume and Area.

The Calculator can calculate basic operations: +, -, /, *, ^, sqrt

The Calculator is able to simplify equations with variables up to and including the distributive law
